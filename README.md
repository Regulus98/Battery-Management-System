# Battery Management System (BMS)

This project focuses on the development of a **Battery Management System (BMS)**, starting with a **passive balancing approach**. The system is designed to monitor and manage battery performance, ensuring **safety, efficiency, and longevity**.

## Project Structure

This repository includes:

### MATLAB Simulations
- Circuit simulations to analyze the behavior and efficiency of the passive balancing method.
- Voltage and current distribution analysis for optimized performance.

### KiCad Design Files
- **Schematic diagrams** detailing the electrical design of the BMS.
- **PCB layout files** for hardware implementation.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementation of an **active balancing system** to improve energy efficiency.
- Integration of **communication protocols** (e.g., CAN, UART) for real-time monitoring.
- Firmware development for **microcontroller-based control and diagnostics**.

This project serves as the foundation for a fully functional BMS, with potential future expansions into **advanced power management, fault detection, and thermal management strategies**.
